. use data from the ezpersistentobject_inspector project to derive known FKs between persistent objects

. continue inserting FKs by hand in ini file

. create a php class that loops on FK defs and checks violations
  + add a script to run the check via cli
  + add a module/view to display results

. create a php class that loops on FK defs and actually creates them in the db

. check for violations of constraints on existing (published versions) data:
  + mandatory attributes
  + string length violations
  + options violations
  + etc...

. check for clustering violations:
  + in mysql ezdb, master vs. slave table
  + in ezdfs, table vs. filesystem (nb: already done in recent eZ versions?)
